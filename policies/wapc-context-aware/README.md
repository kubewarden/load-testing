Please, note well: this file and the scaffold were generated from [a
template](https://github.com/kubewarden/rust-policy-template). Make
this project yours!

You can use `cargo generate -g https://github.com/kubewarden/rust-policy-template.git`
to create your Policy from this template.

# Kubewarden policy context-aware-load-tests

## Description

This policy will reject pods that have a name `invalid-pod-name`. If
the pod to be validated has a different name, or if a different type
of resource is evaluated, it will be accepted.

## Settings

This policy has no configurable settings. This would be a good place
to document if yours does, and what behaviors can be configured by
tweaking them.
